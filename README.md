Project Title: Element Wars

Project Description: Element wars is a similar game to rock paper and scissors but instead, it uses water, fire, and wind. Fire beats wind but loses to water Wind beats water loses to fire and Water beats fire loses to wind. Moreover, the structure is flexible and it's possible to add new elements, increasing the complexity and making the game more fun! When you visit the website 2 buttons, normal mode and impossible mode appear. In normal mode the user chooses one of the elements, then the server generates a number that corresponds to the element and sends it to the client. Then the client compares two inputs and decides the winner. In impossible mode, the computer chooses the element based on the user input so that it always wins. When you choose difficulty and the game starts, buttons of elements appear and you have to choose one. This game will go up to 5 rounds, after each round the winning table for the game is shown. There will also be a scoreboard displaying how many wins/losses there are in both game modes. At any time itâ€™s possible to go to the main screen by pressing the home button.
