Project Title: Element Wars

Project Description: Element wars is a similar game to rock paper and scissors but instead, it uses water, fire, and wind. Fire beats wind but loses to water Wind beats water loses to fire and Water beats fire loses to wind. When you visit the website 3 buttons will appear, normal mode, impossible mode and finally playerVplayer mode. In normal mode the user chooses one of the elements, then the server generates a number that corresponds to the element and sends it to the client. Then the client compares two inputs and decides the winner. In impossible mode, the computer chooses the element based on the user input so that it always wins. In playerVplayer mode the first player chooses and element then the second player will choose the next one. When you choose difficulty and the game starts, pictures of elements appear, and you must choose one. This game will go up to 5 rounds, after each round the winning table for the game is shown. There will also be a scoreboard displaying how many wins/losses there are in both game modes. At any time, itâ€™s possible to go to the main screen by pressing the home button or by clicking the exit button to exit the game completely.





- When the program is opened it starts with it displays the home screen and will have three different modes which will redirect the user.

- Once they one of the modes are chosen there will be a page explaining the rules of the game before playing 

- Normal mode will receive a random number and will take the user input to compare them, will also take either fire wind or water and display pictures of either one

- Impossible mode will check what the user has inputted and make the user lose every time, will also take either fire wind, or water and display pictures of either one

- PlayerVPlayer mode will check what the first player has inputted then the what the second player then compares the result 

- Will display the scoreboard at the top right of the screen and it will count as 1 win to whoever win

- Will have five rounds but will show the current score of the five rounds

- Will display fire pictures when chosen will have up to 5 pictures for 5 rounds

- Will display wind pictures when chosen will have up to 5 pictures for 5 rounds

- Will display water pictures when chosen will have up to 5 pictures for 5 rounds

- After the game the home button will take the user back to the home screen to change the game mode

- The exit button will exit completely and will say thanks for playing message after can not do anything else

- Numbers will be the deciding factor to see which element wins for example 1 will be for fire, 2 for wind and 3 for water
